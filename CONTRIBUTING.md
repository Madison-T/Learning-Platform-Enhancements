## ðŸ§­ Folder Structure

- `plugins/` â€” Each SCORM plugin has its own folder:
  - `drag-and-drop/`
  - `find-the-error/`
  - `complete-the-code/`
  - `timed-sequence/`
  - `formatted-code-block/`
- `docs/` â€” Project documentation, reports, and meeting notes
- `guides/` â€” Technical guides (e.g. SCORM fixes, iDevice creation)
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` â€” Templates for bugs and feature requests

---

## ðŸ”§ Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<plugin-or-change>
   ```

2. Make your changes inside the correct folder

3. ðŸ›  **Before Testing SCORM Completion Locally**

   Make sure you've applied the required changes to your local `SCOFunctions.js` file in eXeLearning.

   Follow the steps here: [guides/SCOFunctions-Fixes.md](guides/SCOFunctions-Fixes.md)

4. Test your plugin using eXeLearning:
   - Export as SCORM 1.2
   - Upload to TalentLMS and test completion tracking

5. Stage and commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: drag-and-drop plugin base"
   ```

6. Push your branch and open a Pull Request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/<plugin-or-change>
   ```

## âœ… Plugin Checklist

Before submitting a pull request, make sure your plugin:
- [ ] Contains a valid `config.xml`
- [ ] Has both `edition/` and `export/` folders
- [ ] Follows the naming conventions (hyphenated lowercase)
- [ ] Works in eXeLearning and exports cleanly
- [ ] Tracks completion properly in TalentLMS when embedded

---

## ðŸ’¬ Style Guidelines

- Use clear, meaningful commit messages
- Comment complex code
- Use hyphen-case for folders and filenames (e.g. `find-the-error`)
- Organize JS/CSS cleanly and modularly
- Keep unrelated changes in separate branches
